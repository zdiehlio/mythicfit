        <p>We hate forms, we don't want to read them and you certainly don't want to fill them out.  Instead, if you have questions or just want to chat join us on <a href='https://discord.gg/GkHbRjv'>Discord</a>, we are probably just slumming around wishing someone would talk to us anyways!  You can also connect with us on <a href='https://twitter.com/mythicfit'>Twitter</a> or <a href='https://www.instagram.com/mythicfit/'>Instagram</a>  We look forward to learning more about you so we can build you into a legend. </p>
